# Python venv Summary

In this document I collect everything for a summary on Python's virtual environments.


## Why one should use virtual environments

For years I have always used the full installation of Python distributions such as WinPython oder Anaconda. This may make sense in certain settings, e.g. in the corporate world, where you can't access the outside internet world as you like due to security constraints. In a private setting however not using fully fledged distributions but virtual environments has as few advantages:

* it takes a lot less space on your disk
* you can define invidual environments for specific tasks: package xyz is not compatible to the rest of your installation? No problem, use a dedicated virtual environment.
